# GitHub_API
Description
This Python script uses the requests library to make an API call to GitHub's API and fetches information about the most-starred Python projects on GitHub. It then uses plotly.express to create an interactive bar chart visualization of these projects based on their star counts.

Code Explanation
API Call: The script constructs a URL to query GitHub's API for repositories with the programming language set to Python and a minimum of 10,000 stars. It uses the requests library to send this GET request.

Response Handling: The response from the API is converted into a dictionary using r.json(), and the script checks if the results are complete.

Processing Data: It extracts relevant information about each repository such as name, URL, star count, owner, and description, and formats them for display.

Visualization: Using plotly.express, the script creates a bar chart where each bar represents a repository. The x-axis shows repository names as clickable links, the y-axis shows the star counts, and hovering over a bar reveals additional information about the repository.

Output: The final visualization is displayed using fig.show().

How to Use
Ensure you have Python installed.
Install the required libraries using pip install requests plotly.
Copy the code into a Python script or Jupyter Notebook.
Run the script, and it will fetch data from GitHub's API and display an interactive bar chart of the most-starred Python projects.
